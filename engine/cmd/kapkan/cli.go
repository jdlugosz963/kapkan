package main

// The command line's grammar, and the subcommand dispatch bolted onto it.
//
// KAPKAN'S FLAGS ARE FROZEN. Operators have `kapkan -config ... -log-format json`
// in a systemd unit, `kapkan -check-config` in CI, `kapkan -s reload` in muscle
// memory, and every one of those must keep working byte for byte. So the rule
// this file follows is: parsing happens exactly where and how it always did, and
// positional arguments are only LOOKED AT afterwards.
//
// WHY THAT IS SAFE, stated precisely because getting it wrong is silent:
// Go's flag package stops parsing at the first argument that is not a flag, and
// leaves the rest in Args(). Every invocation kapkan has ever accepted consists
// only of flags, so for all of them Args() is empty and this file's dispatch is
// unreachable — the code below the dispatch is the same code, reached the same
// way, with the same values. Nothing about `-flag`, `--flag`, `-flag=value`,
// `-flag value`, flag order, or the `--` terminator changes, because none of
// that is re-implemented here: flag.FlagSet still does all of it.
//
// The one deliberate change is that an unrecognised positional argument is now
// an error instead of being ignored. `kapkan wat` used to start the daemon; it
// now prints the command list and exits 2. That is not an invocation anyone has,
// and silently starting a daemon for a typo'd command would be the worst
// possible reading of it.
//
// WHERE THE PARSING LIVES. The flags used to be declared inline in main(), which
// made the grammar untestable without exec'ing a binary — and "write tests that
// pin the existing grammar first" is not optional for a change like this. They
// moved into parseFlags with the error-handling mode as a parameter, so
// TestFlagInventoryIsFrozen and TestExistingInvocationsAreUntouched can drive the
// real declarations with ContinueOnError while main keeps the ExitOnError
// behaviour flag.CommandLine always had.
